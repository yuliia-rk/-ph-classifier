# -ph-classifier
A simple Python tool to classify a solution as acidic, neutral, or basic based on its pH value.
## Features

- Prompts the user for a pH value.
- Classifies the value:
  - Acidic (0 < pH < 7)
  - Neutral (pH == 7)
  - Basic (7 < pH < 14)
- Includes robust error handling for invalid numeric input and values outside the standard pH range.
- Features an interactive loop allowing for continuous use until the user decides to quit.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python Input/Output
- Conditional Statements (`if/elif/else`)
- Error Handling (`try/except`)
- Loop Control (`while`, `break`, `continue`)

## How to Run

1.  Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2.  Clone the repository or download the `ph_classifier.py` file.
3.  In your terminal, navigate to the file's directory and run:
    ```bash
    python ph_classifier.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts. Type 'done' to exit.
